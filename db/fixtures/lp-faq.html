<h2>1) What is Lesson Planet Community?</h2>
Lesson Planet Community is a free discussion forum, where educators can start and participate in teaching-related conversations with other professionals, review online resources, find help with thorny classroom issues, get ideas and inspiration, discuss Lesson Planet articles, and weigh in on topics from best footwear to implementing Common Core State Standards.

<h2>2) How do I join?</h2>
If you are already a Member of Lesson Planet, you are automatically part of the Community. Just log in using your Lesson Planet account information (email address and password) to create discussion topics or post.
If you're new to Lesson Planet, you can sign up [link to sign up/sign in] to participate in the Community, completely free, using Facebook or simply by providing your name, email address, and a password.

<h2>3) What if I disagree with posts by others?</h2>
We welcome healthy, robust conversations. Among committed professionals, that can often mean disagreement or conflicting points of view. Feel free to express your disagreement or differences of opinion, but please do so in ways that keep lines of communication open.

<h2>4) What should I do if I see inappropriate or offensive content?</h2>
If you witness bad behavior, do not encourage it by responding. Simply ignore or flag it. Ignoring it will avoid giving undue attention to those who behave poorly, thereby discouraging the negative behavior. If you encounter offensive or hate-based material, flagging it alerts moderators and the community of your concern.

<h2>5) What content may I share in Lesson Planet Community?</h2>
You may post any of original content that contributes to the topic at hand. Please do not post others' work without citing authorship. You may share great ideas you find on Pinterest or other social media in the Lesson Planet Community.
